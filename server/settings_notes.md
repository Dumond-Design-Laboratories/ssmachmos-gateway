# We probably want to be able to control:

## Wake Up
- Wake up interval
- Have a schedueler on the gateway for next wake up

## Settings
- Sampling frequency (vibration & audio)
- Turn on/off some measurement types
- Length of samples (vibration & audio)

## openPHM
- Change the name of the sensor
