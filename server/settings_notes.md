# We probably want to be able to control:

## Wake Up
- Wake up interval
- Next wake up
- With option "automatic settings" with same wake up interval for every sensor (different for different measurement types)
- Have a schedueler on the gateway

## Settings
- Sampling frequency (vibration & acoustic)
- Turn on/off some measurement types
- Length of samples (vibration & acoustic)

## openPHM
- Change the name of the sensor
